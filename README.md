## Introduction
The release of harmful gases into the environment undoubtedly has adverse effects on human health. Among the primary contributors to the heightened emission of these toxic gases into the atmosphere are the industrial activities conducted by companies globally. 
This project seeks to evaluate advancements and uncover patterns that can optimize efficiency on the path to achieving carbon neutrality by the early 2050s.
Carbon neutrality, often referred to as net-zero carbon emissions, stands as a pivotal ambition in the global fight against climate change. In essence, it signifies a balance between the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere and the quantity that is removed, resulting in a net-zero carbon footprint.

## Background of the project 
In this project, I use Microsoft excel to analyze 866 commercial products carbon footprints (PCFs) across 30 industries from 28 countries to drive insights to answer pertinent questions of SDGs goals to reduce emissions by 45-50% by 2030 and achieve net zero - globally - in the early 2050s.

**_Disclaimer_** : _The dataset was downloaded raw from nature.com website as an excel file. Nature.com stores product carbon footprints (PCFs) for various companies. PCFs are the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to a given product, measured in CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent). The data is from 2013 to 2017_.

## About The Data

Data tables encompassing information on gas emissions across different years, product lifecycles, corporate emissions, and the carbon footprint of products from 28 countries were gathered and systematically analyzed. The dataset's comprehensive details proved instrumental in achieving the project's objectives.

## Tool used: 

Microsoft Excel was used for the entire analytical process.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
This stage was executed using Microsoft's Power Query editor. The dataset exhibited certain issues such as the presence of null values, Duplicates, inconsistent column naming conventions, values requiring conversion, and incorrect data types. No duplicates or outliers were identified during this process.

# Conclusion and recommendations


## Conclusion: 


In conclusion, the analysis reveals significant insights into global carbon footprints and intensities. Spain emerges as the country with the highest carbon footprint, indicating a need for targeted sustainability measures. The USA leads in carbon intensity, demanding attention to industry-specific emissions. Equipment and Machinery contribute substantially to carbon emissions, emphasizing the imperative for greener technologies. Notably, carbon intensity peaked in 2013, urging a focus on historical trends for informed decision-making. The year 2017 witnessed the lowest carbon footprint, underscoring potential success in emission reduction strategies. Examining industry-specific data, Electrical Equipment and Machinery stand out with the highest carbon intensity, emphasizing the sector's environmental impact.
